#my-steam-games-project
My Steam Game History Exploration Project

My goals:
- Practicing queries
- Practicing using open raw data
- Practicing data cleaning
- Finding out how much time I spent on playing steam games, how many games I actually played out of all games, my top-5 games by hours and my most favorite genre in Steam

I used this raw data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicentearce/steam-and-steam-spy-raw-datasets?select=steamspy_data.csv
