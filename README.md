My Steam Game History Exploration Project

My goals:
- Mastering queries
- Finding out as much info as possible about my game history in Steam
- Finding out my most favorite genre 
- Train using my data and open raw data
- Try Data Cleaning

I used this open raw data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicentearce/steam-and-steam-spy-raw-datasets?select=steamspy_data.csv
